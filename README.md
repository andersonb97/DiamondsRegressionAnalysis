# DiamondsRegressionAnalysis

This is a regression analysis that I preformed based off a Kaggle dataset. The Diamonds dataset
contains approximately 54,000 observations. A teammate and I worked through a multiple regression
analysis involving exploritory data analysis, checking regression assumptions, data transformation,
and predictions regarding the data. It is a good example of my ability to preform regression and 
my understanding of multiple statistical concepts.
